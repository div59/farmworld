        <h1>Organic Fertilizers</h1>
        <div class="para my-4 mx-4">
            Organic fertilizers are fertilizers that are naturally produced. Fertilizers are materials that can be added
            to soil or plants, in order to provide nutrients and sustain growth. Typical organic fertilizers include all
            animal waste including meat processing waste, manure, slurry, and guano; plus plant based fertilizers such
            as compost; and biosolids. Inorganic "organic fertilizers" include minerals and ash. The organic-ness refers
            to the Principles of Organic Agriculture, which determines whether a fertilizer can be used for commercial
            organic agriculture, not whether the fertilizer consists of organic compounds.
            <p>Examples and sources
                The main organic fertilizers are, peat, animal wastes, plant wastes from agriculture, and treated sewage
                sludge.</p>
            <h2> Minerals</h2>
            <p>
                Minerals can be mined from fossil products of animal activity, such as greensand (anaerobic marine
                deposits), some limestones (fossil shell deposits),and some rock phosphates (fossil guano). Adding
                limestone or “liming” a soil is a way to raise pH. By raising the pH of a soil, microbial growth can be
                stimulated, which in turn increases biological processes, enabling nutrients to flow more freely through
                the soil. When nutrients flow freely they are more accessible to plants and therefore can increase plant
                health and mass. If the soil is already pH balanced, liming the soil, would be ineffective.

            <h2>Animal source</h2>
            <span>
                <p>
                    Animal sourced materials include both animal manures and residues from the slaughter of animals
                    Manures are derived from milk-producing dairy animals, egg-producing poultry, and animals raised for
                    meat and hide production, or sport and recreation. Manure is an abundant resource with estimations
                    for
                    cattle manure in the US alone reaching two billion tons annually and one hen has the potential to
                    produce a cubic foot of manure every six months. By adding manure to crops it adds nitrogen,
                    potassium, phosphorus, sulfur, magnesium and calcium. While also increasing soil stability by
                    increasing organic material, increasing water infiltration, it can add bacteria diversity and over
                    time
                    reduce the impacts of soil erosion.[However, there is organic manure and non-organic manure. In
                    order for manure to be considered organic it must come from organic livestock or certified organic
                    growers. If organic manure is not available, they are permitted to use non-organic manure as long as
                    the animals have room to roam, are not kept in the dark, and growers abstain from using genetically
                    modified feeds.

                        width="300px" height="300px" srcset=""></center>Fresh manure, right from the stall, can cause issues
                    because it can be too high in
                    ammonia, or contain bacteria from the animal’s gut. This can have an adverse effect on plants as the
                    ammonia can burn the roots and microbes from the animal’s gut can harm the microorganisms in the
                    soil,
                    killing them, or contaminate produce, such as E. coli and salmonella.

            <h2>Plant</h2>
            <span>
                <p>Plant
                    Processed organic fertilizers include compost, humic acid, grain meal, amino acids, and seaweed
                    extracts. Other examples are natural enzyme-digested proteins. Decomposing crop residue (green
                    manure)
                    from prior years is another source of fertility. <center><img

                    Compost provides little in the means of nutrients to plants, but it does provide soil stability
                    through
                    increasing organic matter. Compost does help microorganisms proliferate which in turn breaks down
                    decaying plant material into substantial bioavailable nutrients for plant to easily assimilate.
                    Compost does not need to be fully plant-based: it is often made with a mix of carbon-rich plant
                    waste
                    and nitrogen-rich animal waste including human excreta as a means to remove pathogens and odor from
                    the
                    latter.</p>

                <p> Grain meals can be made of corn gluten, alfalfa, cottonseed, or soybean. Most supply nitrogen and
                    potassium, but soybean meal provides nitrogen and phosphorus. When initially spread they can cause
                    an increase in ammonia within the soil and burn seeds, it is recommended to use these after plants
                    have
                    developed, to ensure crop success.</p>

            <h2>Peat</h2>
            <p>
                Peat, or turf, is plant material that is only partially decomposed. It is a source of organic matter.
                Soil with higher levels of organic matter are less likely to compact, which improves the soil aeration
                and water drainage, as well as assists in supporting soil microbial health.It is sometimes credited as
                being the most widely use organic fertilizer and by volume is the top organic amendment.</p>
            <h2>Human waste</h2>
            <span>
                <p>
                    Main articles: Biosolids and Reuse of human excreta
                    Sewage sludge, also known as biosolids, is effluent that has been treated, blended, composted, and
                    sometimes dried until deemed biologically safe. As a fertilizer it is most commonly used on
                    non-agricultural crops such as in silviculture or in soil remediation.
                    Use of biosolids in agricultural production is less common, and the National Organic Program of the
                    USDA (NOP) has ruled that biosolids are not permitted in organic food production in the U.S.; while
                    biologic in origin (vs mineral), sludge is unacceptable due to toxic metal accumulation,
                    pharmaceuticals, hormones, and other factors. <center><img

                            alt="" width="300px" height="300px" srcset=""> </center>


                    With concerns about human borne pathogens coupled with a growing preference for flush toilets and
                    centralized sewage treatment, biosolids have been replacing night soil (from human excreta), a
                    traditional organic fertilizer that is minimally processed.</p>
