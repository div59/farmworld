    <h1>Chemical Fertilizers</h1> <br>
    <p>Chemical fertilizers, such as urea, diammonium phosphate (DAP), and single superphosphate (SSP), are used to
        maintain the shortage of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium in the soil. However, most of these fertilizers are
        lost as they flow or evaporate.</p>
    <h2>Three Main Classes of Fertilizers </h2>
    <p>
        1. Nitrate fertilizers
        Nitrogen-based fertilizers, the largest and most important group, take several steps to make. The raw materials
        are the nitrogen in air and the hydrogen from natural gas/methane (CH4). 
          <center><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/active-agriscience/images/w_1920,h_1272/f_webp,q_auto/v1643052038/granule-fertilizer/granule-fertilizer.jpg?_i=AA" alt="" srcset="" width="300px" height="300px">  </center> When mixed under high temperature and
        pressure, the resulting product is ammonia (NH3). This intermediate product is oxidized to produce nitric acid
        (HNO3), which results in the mineral fertilizers of ammonium nitrate (AN) and, when mixed with CO2, urea. A
        third type of nitrogen-based fertilizer is urea ammonium nitrate (UAN), made by mixing AN, urea, and water.
    </p> <br>
    <p>

        2. Phosphorus fertilizers
        This group of fertilizers come from phosphate rock, a mined ore. When phosphate concentrate is treated with
        sulfuric acid (H2SO4), it becomes either single superphosphate (SSP) or phosphoric acid.  <center><img src="https://plantcaretoday.com/wp-content/uploads/phosphorus-fertilizer-11302016.jpg" alt=""  width="300px" height="300px" srcset=""></center>  This acid is mixed with
        ammonia to produce monoammonium phosphate (MAP) or diammonium phosphate (DAP). The fertilizer triple
        superphosphate (TSP) can be made by concentrating phosphoric acid or further concentrating phosphate. </p> <br>
    <p>
        3. Potassium fertilizers
        This fertilizer is also derived from mined ore: potash rock, an amalgam of potassium carbonate and potassium
        salts. <center><img src="https://growyouryard.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/how-to-add-potassium-to-soil.jpg" alt=""  width="300px" height="300px" srcset=""></center>  The process for making potassium fertilizers begins with concentrating potash and then treating it to
        make a potassium chloride solution. From this solution comes muriate of potash (MOP), potassium nitrate (KN)
        when mixed with nitric acid, and sulfate of potash (SOP) when mixed with sulfuric acid.</p> <br>
    <h2>The Importance of Using Chemical Fertilizers</h2>
    <p>

        When it comes to the advantages of using fertilizers in agriculture, it’s all about efficiency. Chemical
        fertilizers allow growers to maximize their crop yield on a specific piece of land — the more the plant grows,
        the better. Fertilizer works to ensure that each piece of land produces as efficiently as possible.

        As long as you know how to approach the use of chemical fertilizers, they can even make otherwise poor quality
        land produce significant yields.
